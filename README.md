Trivial Drive is a captivating Flutter-based mobile game that simulates a fun driving adventure, where players manage fuel resources, accumulate miles, and unlock premium features through seamless in-app purchases. Built with Material Design 3 for a polished, responsive UI, it integrates the `in_app_purchase` package for secure, subscription-enabled monetization—offering gas packs, infinite fuel upgrades, and boost modes—while featuring achievement tracking, daily rewards, and social sharing via `share_plus`. Leveraging `lottie` for smooth animations and `shared_preferences` for persistent state, this lightweight package delivers an engaging, monetization-ready template for indie developers to prototype and deploy cross-platform experiences effortlessly.
